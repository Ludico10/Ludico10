## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You have reached my main page, where I post more or less large and complete projects.  
ðŸ”­You can also see some of my developments as part of university lab work by visiting [the page](https://github.com/Labs-island)   
ðŸŒ±Currently, I am trying to develop in the field of machine learning.  
To study deep learning architectures and libraries, I use notebooks, which I try to publish on [my Gist](https://gist.github.com/Ludico10)  
I warn you that I leave some descriptions and comments in Russian, which I would correct if my projects are of interest to anyone!
